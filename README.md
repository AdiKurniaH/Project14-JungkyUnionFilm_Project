# Film Junky Union Project
Film Junky Union is a new community for classic film fans developing a system for filtering and categorizing film reviews. Its main mission is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. We will use the IMBD movie review dataset with polarity labeling to create a model that can classify positive and negative reviews. 

## Objective 
- Create and evaluate models. This model must have at least an F1 score of 0.85.
- Create a classification model based on logistic regression and gradient boosting.
